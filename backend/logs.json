Based on the live search results provided, it appears that you are asking about flashing live data drivers.\n\nTo answer your question accurately, I will use the search results to provide the following information:\n\nTo flash live data drivers, you will need to use a software solution such as EFILive, PCMflash, or similar tools. These tools provide the capability to reprogram or update the engine control unit (ECU) or powertrain control module (PCM) with new software or calibration data.\n\nThe specific steps and procedures for flashing live data drivers will depend on the make and model of the vehicle, as well as the type of ECU or PCM being used. Some examples of how to flash live data drivers include:\n\n* Using EFILive software to load a custom tuning file onto a .CTZ format device (as described in the \"EFI Live Pass-Through Flash Process\" article)\n* Using PCMflash software to reprogram the ECU or PCM of various vehicle makes and models (as described in the \"PCMflash\" article)\n* Using a universal module such as Denso SH705x Bootloader or BSL TriCore to flash live data drivers (as described in the \"PCMflash\" article)\n\nIt's worth noting that flashing live data drivers can be a complex process and requires a moderate level of computer competency. It's also important to note that flashing live data drivers may void the warranty of the vehicle or its components, and may also require specialized tools and equipment.\n\nIf you have any further questions or would like more information on flashing live data drivers, please let me know."
